      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p>Running a hotel is a 24-hour operation, one that does not always happen in front of a computer - we saw a increasing need from hotels to be able to perform daily operations on their phones, and at the same time competitors launched mobile apps to cater their needs.</p>

      <h5>The team</h5>
      <p>Product Owner, UI/UX Designer, UX Researcher, Full-stack developers, Quality Assurance.</p>

      <h5>Research and design</h5>
      <p>We visited hotels in Bangkok and Seoul to find out more about the different roles and how they use our competitors apps today. Based on the research we developed 5 personas which we used when developing concepts.</p>
      <p>As we designed the MVP concepts of the app, hotels were brought in to test prototypes. Based on the findings we were able to tweak the designs prior to development.</p>

      <h5>Validation and improvements</h5>
      <p>After launching the MVP version we developed more features as well as improving existing functionality.</p>
      <p>Whenever we change existing features we run A/B tests to assure that we only release better experiences. This oftentimes leads to fine-tuning and tweaking the designs before arriving at a desired solution.</p>
